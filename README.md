# Smart-cart-with-automatic-billing  
The Smart Cart project is an IoT-based retail solution developed using the ESP32
microcontroller, RFID technology, and dual-display integration with an I2C LCD and
an OLED screen. While RFID-based item detection and billing systems already exist in
modern retail environments, our project introduces a more interactive and user-friendly
approach. The system allows customers to add or remove items from their cart using
RFID tags, controlled through physical buttons for Add, Remove and Total
functions. The LCD provides step-by-step instructions and feedback, while the OLED
continuously shows the running total, enhancing the shopping experience
