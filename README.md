‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle
Product Scanning: Each item is assigned an RFID tag. When placed near the RFID reader, the tag is scanned.

Cart Management: The user can add or remove items using the respective buttons.

Display:

OLED: Shows the running total of added items.

LCD: Displays current action/status messages.

Billing: On pressing the 'Total' button, the complete amount is shown.

All operations are managed in real-time by the ESP32.

‚úÖ Features
Real-time item addition/removal.

Dual-display output (item status + total price).

Simple UI using buttons.

No manual billing or cashier required
